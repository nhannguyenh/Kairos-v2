## Core Capabilities

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| **End-to-End ETL Pipeline** | Raw API → Clean Dataset. Multi-timeframe OHLCV (1m–1d) collection from 3 exchanges (Binance/OKX/Bybit) via CCXT + WebSocket. Auto-handles timestamp alignment, gaps & missing candles. |
| **Multi-Timeframe Feature Engineering** | 49 indicators ✓ across 8 timeframes (1m–1d). No look-ahead bias: `resample + shift index + forward-fill + live candle`. Each bar only sees historically available data. |
| **Vectorized Processing** | 100x+ speedup vs loops. Process millions of rows in minutes (Polars/Pandas). |
| **ML Pipeline (PyTorch)** | Auto-labeling → 80-dim feature extraction → ResBlock MLP → walk-forward validation. Identical `calc_core_features()` for train & inference (prevents train-serve skew). |
| **DuckDB Data Warehouse** | Every backtest execution is stored in the warehouse with a unique `run_id`. SQL queries: winrate/PnL/drawdown analytics grouped by hour/day/regime. |
| **Statistical Backtesting** | Walk-forward split + look-ahead prevention (data & execution layers). Signal on bar N → Entry on bar N+1. |
| **Hyperparameter Optimizer** | Inputs: indicator + timeframe + trials. Outputs: optimized parameters + DSR/Sharpe/Sortino + IS/OOS reports. Thousands of trials/minute. |
| **Indicator Live Workbench** | Interactive sandbox: change parameters → instant vectorized backtest → view signals/entry overlays real-time on charts. |
| **Analytics Dashboard (PyQt6)** | Equity curves, drawdowns, daily PnL calendar, session heatmaps (win% by hour×day), trade scatter plots. |

**Layer 1 — Data Acquisition (`/lay_du_lieu`)**: Ingests market data, order books, and macro indicators via REST and WebSocket.

**Layer 2 — Feature Engineering (`/chien_luoc/phan_tich_ky_thuat`)**: Computes signal indicators (49 indicators across 8 timeframes) and ML training vectors (80 dimensions) in parallel.

**Layer 3 — ML Core (`/ml`)**: Predicts the current market regime. Regimes 0 and 7 pause trading; regimes 1-6 adjust strategy weights.

**Layer 4 — Strategy Gating (`/chien_luoc`)**: Routes signals to 5 active models (Breakout, Squeeze, Trend, Mean Reversion, Scalping), weighting them based on the active ML regime.

**Layer 5 — Data Warehouse (`/utils/kho_du_lieu.py`)**: Stores results to DuckDB using unique `run_id` keys.

**Layer 6 — Visualization (`/hien_thi`)**: Draws equity curves, heatmaps, and candlesticks via PyQt6.

> *For detailed code paths and descriptions of each module in the layer, refer to the [Detailed Technical Reference Manual](detailed_documentation.md).*

## 5. FEATURE ENGINEERING & ENSEMBLE SCORING

### Multi-Timeframe Data Pipeline — Principle Summary

The core challenge of multi-timeframe vectorized backtests is **time-alignment**: at each 1m bar, HTF indicators must reflect the exact information known at that timestamp. The system aggregates all 8 timeframes from raw 1m OHLCV.

**4-step process to prevent look-ahead bias in all indicator functions:**
1. **Resample** — Reconstruct HTF candles from 1m price lines.
2. **Shift index** — Assign calculated HTF values to the timestamp when the HTF candle *closes* + 1 period (eliminating look-ahead leaks).
3. **Forward-fill** — Lower timeframe (1m) rows read the last locked HTF value.
4. **Live indicator** — Calculates indicators by combining locked history and the current forming 1m close.

> *For pipeline flowcharts, shift index logic, concrete Bollinger Bands 15m examples, and common look-ahead errors, see [Data & Indicators](detailed_documentation.md#data-pipeline) in the Technical manual.*

### Ensemble Scoring — Weighted Scoring System

Rather than relying on a single rule, KAIROS combines indicators into a single score:

| Module | Analytical Focus | Baseline Weight |
|---|---|---|
| `xu_huong.py` | EMA configurations, ADX strength, structural trend | High (1h) |
| `cau_truc_gia.py` | Breakouts, Fair Value Gaps, Pivot points | High (4h) |
| `khoi_luong.py` | Volume surges, VWAP deviation, OBV delta | Medium |
| `dong_luong_dao_chieu.py` | RSI divergence, MACD momentum, Stoch extremes | Medium |
| `bien_dong.py` | ATR ranges, Bollinger squeezing, Keltner | Low-Medium |
| `vi_the.py` | CVD orderflow, order book imbalance | Validation |
| `chu_ky.py` | Session boundaries, funding fee window filters | Gating |

**Ensemble Formula:**
```text
Total Score = Σ (Feature_Score_i × Weight_i × Timeframe_Multiplier)
Signal = BUY  if Total Score ≥ Threshold
         SELL if Total Score ≤ -Threshold
         HOLD otherwise
```

Weights shift dynamically based on the ML regime — when classified as "Ranging", the weight of Mean Reversion features increases, and Trend features decrease, adapting the model to market conditions.

## 6. ML PIPELINE: REGIME CLASSIFICATION

### Classification Task

**Input:** 80 features — 18 technical indicators × 4 timeframes (5M / 15M / 1H / 4H) + 8 memory state variables.
**Output:** 8 classification classes (Regimes 0-7) mapping the market state.

| Regime | Label | Active Strategies |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `Frozen` | No trading (market flatline) |
| 1 | `Squeezing` | Compression (Squeeze model active) |
| 2 | `Early Trend` | Breakout (Volatility breakouts active) |
| 3 | `Strong Trend` | Trend Following (Trend models active) |
| 4 | `Climax` | Mean Reversion (Reversion from extremes active) |
| 5 | `Retracement` | Mean Reversion (Targeting VWAP/EMA active) |
| 6 | `Turbulent` | Scalping (Rangebound scalper active) |
| 7 | `Liquidation Sweep` | No trading (High risk/choppy spikes) |

### Training Workflow

```text
Raw OHLCV (1m)
    ↓ Feature Extraction (Polars, tao_feature.py) → 80 dimensions
    ↓ Labeling (trading_teacher.py) → Labeled Dataset
    ↓ Training: TradingMLP (PyTorch ResBlock × 3, skip connections)
    ↓ Evaluation: confusion matrix, walk-forward validation
    ↓ Deployment: model_pytorch.pth + scaler_params.json
    ↓ Inference: bar-to-bar (~20-35ms) or vectorized batch (~500ms)
```

> *For `TradingMLP` layers, hyperparameters, loss functions, and label generation, see [ML Section](detailed_documentation.md#ml-regime) of the technical reference.*

* **Trade list panel**: Interactive trade records. Click to focus and highlight on the chart.
* **Multi-timeframe switcher**: Switch between 1m/3m/5m/15m/1h/4h/1d.

---

### 7.4 Walk-Forward Parameter Optimizer (Advanced Engine)

Answers the central question: *"Is this parameter robust, or is it just the result of overfitting?"* Accessible via **CLI** (`python main.py → [8]`) or the **Optimizer tab** in the desktop GUI.

| Aspect | Description |
|---|---|
| **Input** | Single indicator / multi-timeframe combination (AND logic), data range (symbols + dates), number of trials, target metric (Sharpe/Sortino…). |
| **Output** | **Best parameter set + entry/exit thresholds** → saved as JSON artifact (`du_lieu/danh_sach_chien_luoc/`), loaded into Backtester/Candlestick/Live · **Ranking table** comparing indicators · **Walk-Forward Report** (In-Sample vs. Out-of-Sample) · equity/drawdown/PnL charts. |
| **Scoring Metrics** | **Deflated Sharpe Ratio** (DSR) to prevent false discoveries. Sharpe/Sortino ratios are adjusted based on trade limits (minimum **30 trades over 14 days**). |
| **Deploy Gatekeeper** | Strategies are only marked as deployable if they meet the following: DSR $\ge$ 90%, OOS/IS ratio $\ge$ 0.8, Out-of-Sample Trades $\ge$ 30, and Profit Factor $\ge$ 1.2. |
| **Performance** | In-memory backtest engine runs thousands of optimization trials per minute without I/O bottlenecks. Supports early stopping. |

> The open-source `toi_uu_hoa/` directory implements Walk-Forward search and DSR testing. The high-performance adaptive version is located in the commercial package `toi_uu_hoa_high`.

## 8. SQL ANALYTICS & DATA WAREHOUSE

Every backtesting run and live trade execution is recorded in **DuckDB**, an embedded serverless database. Trades are associated with unique `run_id` keys, enabling cross-run and cross-strategy SQL analytics.

The system records results from **5 modes** (backtest_bar, backtest_da_luong, backtest_vector, demo, realtime) and supports **over 15 analytical queries**: win rates by hour/day/regime/session/strategy, Sharpe/Sortino ratios, Kelly criteria, Monte Carlo simulations, streak analytics, and transition matrices.

### Sample SQL Query Output — Winrate by ML Regime

| regime | regime_name | trades | winrate_pct | total_pnl | avg_pnl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Strong Trend | 142 | 61.3% | +842.5 | +5.9 |
| 2 | Early Trend | 98 | 54.1% | +310.2 | +3.2 |
| 6 | Turbulent | 215 | 44.2% | -180.4 | -0.8 |
| 4 | Climax | 76 | 48.7% | -42.1 | -0.6 |

This table allows a developer to identify underperforming regimes (like Regime 6) and adjust strategy configurations accordingly.

> *For database schemas (backtest_run, lenh, signal_log) and analytical SQL queries, see [SQL Section](detailed_documentation.md#luu-tru) of the technical manual.*

<a name="9"></a>

## 9. RISK MANAGEMENT & VALIDATION GUARDRAILS

* **Overfitting Protection**: Avoids random sample shuffling; training/validation uses walk-forward splits.
* **Overfitting Detection**: Drawdown circuit breakers pause models if performance deviates from backtest limits.
* **Dynamic SL/TP**: ATR-based trailing stops, constrained to safety bounds (SL: 0.5%–15%, TP: 1%–30%).
* **Multi-Factor Leverage**: Computes leverage based on ATR volatility, ADX trend strength, volume surge, breakout strength, and Bollinger compression. Clamped in `[1, max_leverage]`.
* **Robustness Testing**: Evaluates models across multi-asset classes and market regimes.

> *For formulas regarding ATR-scaled stops and dynamic leverage, see [Strategy & Execution](detailed_documentation.md#chien-luoc) in the technical manual.*

## 13. ROADMAP

*This represents a proposal from the developer, not a commitment.*

The developer plans to **restrict future development on KAIROS v2** to focus resources on **KAIROS v3**. The proposed final additions for v2 are:

**Integrate Non-OHLCV Data as Gating Filters for Live Trading**: Hook Open Interest, CVD, Websocket volumes, and liquidation streams (already available in `/lay_du_lieu/`) into strategy routing rules (`chien_luoc/quan_ly_chien_luoc.py`). Use these orderflow indicators to block trades when technical indicators are triggered at inappropriate timeframes or market regimes.

Implementation order: Solidify OHLCV models → Link WebSocket orderflow streams → Validate in Demo/Live modes (not backtestable).

## 14. TUTORIAL: RESEARCHING A STRATEGY FROM SCRATCH

Follow this workflow to research and deploy a strategy in KAIROS:

                       ▼
            Bar-to-Bar Backtest  ← Accurate validation (adds SL/TP, fees)
                       │
                       ▼
            Demo / Paper Trading ← Live market validation without risk
                       │
                       ▼
               Live Trading      ← Real money execution, start small
```

**6 Sequential Phases:**
1. **Load Historical Data** — Collect multi-year historical datasets. Scan and clean any gaps.
2. **Strategy Research (2a)** — Write signal rules in `logic_vectorized/chien_luoc/`. Ensure your outputs are scored between `-1.0` and `+1.0`.
3. **ML Regime Research (2b)** — Train the regime classifier using option `[6] ML Training` from the CLI menu.
4. **Vectorized Backtests** — Run fast simulations to evaluate the strategy's statistical edge. Target a Profit Factor > 1.3 on Out-of-Sample data.
5. **Bar-to-Bar Backtests** — Simulate under realistic conditions (slippage, execution delay, trailing ATR stop). If results drop by >30% compared to vectorized tests, check for look-ahead leaks.
6. **Demo → Live** — Run in Demo mode for 2-4 weeks. If paper trading is successful, deploy to live trading starting with 10-20% of capital allocation.

## 15. RISK DISCLAIMER

**Regarding Backtest Performance**: Backtesting relies entirely on historical data. **Past performance does not guarantee future results**. Market conditions and structures change over time.

**System Limitations**: Backtesting calculates performance on 1m OHLCV bars, not tick-by-tick order books. Live slippage, fees, and execution delays can vary. Orderflow orderbook datasets are only available in Live/Demo modes.

**ML Regime Classification**: Machine learning models assume stationary market features. Model drift can occur during unexpected market volatility or structural breaks.

**Disclaimer**: This codebase is meant for **educational, academic, and research purposes**. It is not investment advice.

### Editions

This public repository contains the open-source **Base edition (Proof-of-Concept)**. The advanced editions of the indicator feature engines and parameter optimizers are kept proprietary:

| Engine | Public Base Edition (PoC) | Closed-source Commercial Editions |
|---|---|---|
| **Indicator** | `Indicator/` | `Indicator_mid` · `Indicator_high` — advanced features with MTF Live Hybrid updates |
| **Optimizer** | `toi_uu_hoa/` | `toi_uu_hoa_high` — adaptive search with faster convergence |

> Licensing inquiries regarding proprietary engines should be directed to the developer.

## 16. AUTHOR'S NOTE

I did not start this project to become a trader. I started it because financial markets are one of the few data science problems that give you an honest answer: if your code is wrong, your backtest will fail immediately; if your methodology is wrong, reality will not spare your capital.

KAIROS v2 was built entirely on OHLCV. Over time, I realized a fundamental limitation: OHLCV is the most public information in the world and is already reflected in the price. No matter how sophisticated a pipeline is, if it only looks at price candles, it is only describing what has already happened. Realizing this did not discourage me — it gave me a clearer understanding of what I was doing.

If I had to choose the two most difficult challenges, I would say **HTF alignment and ML** — harder than everything else combined. HTF is hard because bugs are silent — you can write a multi-timeframe pipeline that looks correct, produces beautiful curves, and yet have no idea that your 4h indicator is looking into the future. There are no exceptions, no warnings — only fake win rates. And ML is hard because of the *problem design*: how do you generate labels that are not circular? How do you prevent look-ahead leaks from slipping into the training features? And the hardest part: how do you know if your model is *learning* or just *memorizing*.

Along with the challenges, there were a few design decisions worth getting right from the beginning: using a single `calc_core_features()` for both training and live inference — change the formula in one place, and both pipelines stay synchronized. Signals appear at bar N, but orders are executed at the `open` of bar N+1. Running two parallel backtesting engines (`logic_bar_to_bar` and `logic_vectorized`) acts as a form of internal cross-validation — when results mismatch, it indicates a discrepancy in simulation rules rather than a strategy flaw.

KAIROS v2 will stay as it is — honest about what it can and cannot do. The next step is **KAIROS v3**, where the problem is redesigned from scratch around multi-source orderflow data ingestion pipelines.

*Sometimes the straightest path to where you want to go is the winding path through where you needed to make mistakes first.*
